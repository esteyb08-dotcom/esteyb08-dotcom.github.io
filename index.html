      <h2>Trail Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Trail Name:</strong>Lake Ingalls Trail</p>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong>Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Central Washington</p>
      <p>
        The Ingalls Lake Trail is one of my favorite trails in Washington because of its mix of forests, 
        views, and the feeling of being just far enough from everything. Below, I’ve put
        together my own quick review, tips, and a link to more details!

      <h2>My Review</h2>
      <p>
        I love this trail because it feels like the perfect mix of challenge,
        beauty, and a great reward. The first mile is a gentle warm-up, and then the switchbacks kick
        in and reward you with awesome views of the surrounding Stuart Range. Depending on the time of year,
        you might see wildflowers (summer), bright orange larches (fall), or even some lingering snow patches (spring).
      </p>
      <p>
        On clear days you can see Mount Stuart, towering just to the northeast of the lake.
        This is also the route climbers take to reach Mount Stuart’s summit, so you’ll see
        a few folks with packs and climbing gear heading up or down.
      </p>
      <p>Be aware that this trail can be quite challenging in sections and requires good physical fitness. Additionally,
        the trail can be crowded during peak seasons, so starting early in the day is advisable to avoid the crowds.
        Finally, this part of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness is home to mountain goats, so be cautious and 
        give them plenty of space if you encounter any.
